Welcome to my mini-Library Management System Application!
This application is a very simple system that uses a command line for users to access a small libray, with books, users, and a list of authors. 
The books in this library can be found in the 'books' module, which houses several methods that include:
 - Adding a book to the library
 - Borrowing a book from the library
 - Returning a book that was borrowed
 - Searching for a specific book in the library
 - Displaying all books currently in the library

When the user selects the book operations option in the main menu, they will have access to all of these functions. 
There is also a module for users, which is a class that includes usernames and id numbers to authenticate users. 
The methods built into the user class include:
 - Regex to validate username and id numbers
 - Function to Add a new user to collection of users 
 - Function to search for a specific user
 - Function to display all current users
 
Finally, there is an authors module that includes a list of authors and a short biography for each. 
The methods included in this class are as follows:
 - Regex to validate author names
 - Function to Display list of all authors with biographies
 - Function to Search for a specific author and their biography
 - Function to add a new author 

This application is very simple, yet allows the user to be able to create a vast library with all kinds of implications. 
Thank you!
